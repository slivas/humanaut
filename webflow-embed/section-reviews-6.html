            that kept coming back to me."

            "I attribute a great deal of the fact that I'm 43 and really do feel like I did,
            possibly better than I did, when I was 18 years old to the idea of continual
            rejuvenation with protocols like this. Stem cell therapy is anincredible thing."

            "As a Cleveland Clinic trained orthopedic spine surgeon, when I heard about regenerative
            injections being performed into intervertebral discs and epidurals, I had to see it with
            my own eyes. When I visited and watched Dr. Adelson operate, what I discovered was
            pleasantly surprising. Dr. Adelson is a skilled spine injector, practices flawless
            sterile technique, is honest and upfront, and is completely professional. I'm happy to
            call Dr. Adelson a trusted colleague and a friend."
