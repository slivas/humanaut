            Is stem cell therapy safe? Is regenerative medicine safe?

              After aesthetic stem cell injections, post-care is simple but important to support
              healing and optimize results. Stay hydrated and avoid alcohol for at least 24 hours
              post-treatment. Skip makeup, saunas, and intense workouts for 24-48 hours to reduce
              infection risk. Wear sun protection for several months following facial microneedling.
              Your provider will recommend a personal plan based on your treatment type and needs.

            How long does it take to see results from joint stem cell therapy?

              It can take 8 to 12 weeks or more to see results from stem cell therapy for joint
              pain. Results take place gradually. Unfortunately, some individuals do not respond to
              therapy.

            Is stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine effective?
          </div>
          <div class="acc-panel">
            <p class="acc-panel-inner">
              Stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine can be very effective. Although some
              people don't respond to therapy, those who do frequently describe the benefits as less
              pain, improved daily function, and better quality of life.
